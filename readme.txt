== Description ==
popBounce is an implementation of exit popup software for WordPress. This plugin is based on [Ouibounce]( http://carlsednaoui.github.io/ouibounce/) by Carl Sednaoui.

Exit popups are meant for increasing conversions and therefore boosting marketing, signups and sales. popBounce displays an inline popup before the user leaves your site. ("Inline popup" means that this is NOT one of those out-dated, annoying popups windows.) Inline popups catch the visitor's attention even if they are in the process of leaving your site.
